## Installation and Setup

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.x or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hazraChandrima/EduConnect.git
   cd EduConnect/
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend/
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=3000

   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

   EMAIL_USER=your_email
   EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password

   IP_ADDRESS=your_local_ip_address

   ```

4. Start the backend server (using nodemon):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The backend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:3000/

---


### ‚öôÔ∏è Frontend Setup

1. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   
   Create two configuration files in the root of your frontend project (cuz Expo with Typescript doesn't support .env fr some reason) :

   **a. app-config.js**
   ```typescript
   // app-config.js
   // This file contains API URLs for different services

   const IP_ADDRESS = "YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS"

   export const APP_CONFIG = {
     API_BASE_URL: `http://${IP_ADDRESS}:3000`,
     API_CHATBOT_URL: `http://${IP_ADDRESS}:5000`,
     API_PDF_QUIZ_URL: `http://${IP_ADDRESS}:8000`,
   };
   ```

   **b. firebase-config.ts**
   ```typescript
   // firebase-config.ts
   // This file contains your Firebase configuration
   export const FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     projectId: "YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID",
     measurementId: "YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID"
   };
   ```
   
   > **Note:** Add these configuration files to your `.gitignore`.

3. Start the React Native development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   The frontend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8081/

### ‚öôÔ∏è EduConnect Chatbot Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd edubot/
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_api_key
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

3. Run the chatbot API:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The chatbot API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ask

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è PDF-to-Quiz Generator Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd PDF-text_to_quiz/
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

3. If you want to run both the functionalities separately:

   - Run the PDF-to-Quiz API:
   ```bash
   uvicorn api_pdf:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
   ```
   The PDF-to-Quiz app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/pdf_to_quizz

   - Run the Text-to-Quiz API:
   ```bash
   uvicorn api_text:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001 --reload
   ```
   The Text-to-Quiz app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8001/text_to_quizz


   **OR** If you want to run both the functionalities simultaneously (on a single port):

   - Run the Text-to-Quiz API:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
   ```
   The PDF/Text-to-Quiz app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
